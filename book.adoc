== What is {feelpp}?

{feelpp} is a unified {cpp} implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and
spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential
equations.

{feelpp} is

 . a **versatile mathematical kernel** solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.

 . a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a wide
   range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order
   methods such as the reduced basis method.

 . a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
   associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
   particular the finite element mathematical framework and
   variational formulations.

 . a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
   thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.

 . a library entirely in {cpp} allowing to create {cpp} complex and typically
   non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and
   health-care.

= Quick Starts

== Installation Quick Start


Using {feelpp} inside
link:../02-docker/what-is-docker.adoc[Docker] is the recommended and
fastest way to use {feelpp}. The
link:../02-docker/README.adoc[docker chapter] is dedicated to Docker
and using {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with
{feelpp} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {feelpp} should
read through the remaining sections of this chapter.

== Syntax Start
