= Data Management Plan

This Data Management Plan provides an overview of data expected to be used and generated in the {feelpp} project and then will follow the <<_2,template series>> of questions in order to go in to more detail.
It will be updated at least once a year or as further information becomes available.

{feelpp} and the associated research projects such as {eye2brain}, {hifimagnet} or {hemotumpp} are producing xref:data-types.adoc[data of various types].

In the case of publications, the {feelpp} consortium will publish them at the project websites (www.feelpp.org and www.cemosis.fr) as well as on the french Open Archives HAL.
