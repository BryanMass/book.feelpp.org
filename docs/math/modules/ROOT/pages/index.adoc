= The Mathematics of Feel++

In this documentation, you will learn about the mathematics behind {feelpp}.

* [x] xref:math:analyse-fonctionnelle:index.adoc[Functional analysis for partial differential equations]
* [x] xref:math:fem:index.adoc[Finite element method]
* [x] xref:math:fem:ch-problemes-coercifs.adoc[Finite element method for coercive problems]
* [x] xref:math:fem:ch-problemes-mixtes.adoc[Finite element method for mixed problems]

When possible, we try to exemplify the mathematics with {feelpp} code and results.
