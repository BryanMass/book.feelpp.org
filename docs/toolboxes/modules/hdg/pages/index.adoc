= Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Toolbox

In many application context, not only do we need the primal variable (_e.g._ the potential or the displacement) but also the dual variable (_e.g_ the flux or the stress).

{feelpp} supports HdG methods and enables primal/dual variables solves.

We provide the xref:math:hdg:index.adoc[Mathematical theory] as well as toolboxes for xref:mixedpoisson.adoc[Mixed Poisson equation] and xref:mixedelasticity.adoc[Mixed Elasticity] equations.
