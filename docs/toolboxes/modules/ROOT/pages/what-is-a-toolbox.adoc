= What is a Toolbox

{feelpp} comes with toolboxes. What are they ?

.Definition: A {feelpp} Toolbox
====
For a given set of partial differential equations for a given physics or set of physics, a {feelpp} toolbox provides:

* the configuration the set of equations through one or several `json` files and `cfg` files
* one or more solution strategies to solve the set of equations
====

== JSON files

`json` files allow to configure a set of partial differential equations, more precisely they define:

* the type and name of the model
* some parameters for the model
* materials properties
* boundary Conditions
* post Processing

Here is a   xref:examples:csm:rotating-winch/index.adoc[biele example] from the Toolbox examples.

== CFG files

`cfg` files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy
