= What is a Toolbox

{feelpp} comes with toolboxes. What are they ?

.Definition: A {feelpp} Toolbox
****
For a given set of partial differential equations for a given physics (_e.g._ xref:toolboxes:cfd:index.adoc[computational fluid dynamics]) or set of physics (_e.g._ xref:toolboxes:fsi:index.adoc[fluid structure interaction]), a {feelpp} toolbox provides:

* the configuration the set of equations through one or several (`.json`) files and (`.cfg`) files
* one or more solution strategies to solve the set of equations
****

Using the xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc#_json_files[JSON] and xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc#_cfg_files[CFG], it is possible to configure and run models by defining the relevant physical quantitiesâ€”such as material properties, loads, constraints, sources, and fluxes.

== JSON files

The Model JSON (`.json`) files allow to configure a set of partial differential equations, more precisely they define:

* [x] <<name_and_type_of_model,Names and Type of Model>>
* [x] <<Parameters,Parameters>>
* [x] <<Materials,Materials>>
* [x] <<BoundaryConditions,Boundary conditions>>
* [x] <<PostProcessing,Post processing>>


=== Names and Type of Model

A model JSON file starts by giving names (long and short) as well as the type of model which will be used by the toolbox.
The latter allows to configure the set of equations associated the toolbox physics.

== CFG files

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.
