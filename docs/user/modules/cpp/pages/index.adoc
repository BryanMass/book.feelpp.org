= Using {feelpp} in {cpp}

To start using {feelpp} in {cpp}, we have setup a xref:minimal.adoc[minimal example] in {uri-org-feelpp}/minimal that you can clone and play with provided you have installed {feelpp}.

Then we have setup {uri-github-feelpp}/feelpp/quickstart examples and we detail the in this documentation the xref:laplacian.adoc[Laplacian quickstart application].
