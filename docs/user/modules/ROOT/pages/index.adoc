= Preface


== What is {feelpp}?
{feelpp} is a unified {cpp} implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and
spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential
equations.

{feelpp} is

. a **versatile mathematical kernel** solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.
. a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a wide
  range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order
  methods such as the reduced basis method.
. a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
  associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
  particular the finite element mathematical framework and
  variational formulations.
. a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
  thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.
. a library entirely in {cpp} allowing to create {cpp} complex and typically
  non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and
  health-care.

== What is the purpose of this manual ?


The purpose of this manual is to allow user

* [x] get started with {feelpp} using xref:quickstart/docker.adoc[Docker] or xref:quickstart/singularity.adoc[Singularity].
* [x] learn using {feelpp} by example

== What is the scope of this manual?

We need to define first what is a {feelpp} user to define the scope.

{feelpp} User::
A {feelpp} user can be either
* an application-user who runs the applications provided by {feelpp} either via Docker or via an installation on a system or infrastructure.
* a dsel-user  who implements {cpp} code using {feelpp} Galerkin domain specific embdedded language, see _e.g._ xref:user::laplacian.adoc[Laplacian].

This book discusses the {feelpp} user perspective.
This book does not discuss {feelpp} API or programming.

== Who is this book for?

This book is for students, engineers, scientists and researchers who want to use {feelpp}:

* [x] solve PDEs using {feelpp} xref:toolbox::index.adoc[toolboxes]
* [x] solve PDEs using the embedded language for Galerkin methods

== Conventions


The following typographical conventions are used in the book

_Italic_ indicates new terms

`typewriter` is used on program listings as well as when referring to
programming elements, _e.g._ functions, variables, statements, data types,
environment variables or keywords.

`\$ typewriter` or `> typewriter` displays commands that the user types literally without the `\$` or `>`.

NOTE: this is a general note.

WARNING: this is a general warning.

CAUTION: be cautious

Hereafter, in the context of tutorial or the documentation of a specific process, four difficulty levels can be displayed:
