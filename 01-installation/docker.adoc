Docker
------

Using {feelpp} inside
link:../02-docker/what-is-docker.adoc[Docker] is the recommended and
fastest way to use {feelpp}. The
link:../02-docker/README.adoc[docker chapter] is dedicated to Docker
and using {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with
{feelpp} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {feelpp} should
read through the remaining sections of this chapter.
